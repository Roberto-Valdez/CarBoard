# CarBoard

CarBoard is an Android app that helps you to diagnose what your car's dashboard lights indicate. Some drivers are often unsure of whether they should pullover and try to fix the problem immediately or if it's safe to continue driving and repair it later. Instead of searching for your car manual or trying to describe to google what the symbol looks like, CarBoard displays some of the most common dashboard lights which a user can click on to get more information.
